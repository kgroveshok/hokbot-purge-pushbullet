Mark read on all pushbullet notifications. 

I've found that the most recent Pushbullet updates is causing Firefox to hang sometimes.

The only way to resolve is to mark all of the notifications as read in the Firefox add-on, however marking each one as read is a PITA and very slow.

This script takes your API key which you store in the file ../pushapi.txt and marks them all read.

The API is quite easy so feel free to adapt the script to suit.
